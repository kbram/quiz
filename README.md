## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

## Installation Instructions
1. Run `https://github.com/kbram/Quiz.git`
2. Create a MySQL database for the project
    * ```mysql -u root -p```, if using Vagrant: ```mysql -u homestead -psecret```
    * ```create database laravelAuth;```
    * ```\q```
3. From the projects root run `cp .env.example .env`
4. Configure your `.env` file
5. Run `composer update` from the projects root folder
6. From the projects root folder run:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravelroles &&
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel2step
```
7. From the projects root folder run `sudo chmod -R 755 ../laravel-auth`
8. From the projects root folder run `php artisan key:generate`
9. From the projects root folder run `php artisan migrate`
10. From the projects root folder run `composer dump-autoload`
11. From the projects root folder run `php artisan db:seed`
12. Compile the front end assets with [npm steps](#using-npm) or [yarn steps](#using-yarn).

#### Build the Front End Assets with Mix
##### Using Yarn:
1. From the projects root folder run `yarn install`
2. From the projects root folder run `yarn run dev` or `yarn run production`
  * You can watch assets with `yarn run watch`

##### Using NPM:
1. From the projects root folder run `npm install`
2. From the projects root folder run `npm run dev` or `npm run production`
  * You can watch assets with `npm run watch`

#### Optionally Build Cache
1. From the projects root folder run `php artisan config:cache`

###### And thats it with the caveat of setting up and configuring your development environment. I recommend [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/master/homestead)

### Seeds
##### Seeded Roles
  * Unverified - Level 0
  * User  - Level 1
  * Administrator - Level 5

##### Seeded Permissions
  * view.users
  * create.users
  * edit.users
  * delete.users

##### Seeded Users
